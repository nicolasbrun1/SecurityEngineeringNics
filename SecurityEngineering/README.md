# Security Engineering IC00AJ63

This repository contains exercises and related material for the course Security Engineering at the University of Oulu.

Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to:
* Understand and analyse complex systems and their threat models
* Make informed decisions about the security of systems during the design stage
* Analyse systems to identify their weaknesses

## Practicalities

The course includes practical exercises for seven weeks on the previously mentioned topics.
In general, you are not required to complete technically challenging tasks to acquire grade 3, but beyond that technical skills might be required.
So be prepared!

The course will use GitHub Classroom for returning the work.
See general instructions [here.](https://ouspg.org/resources/github/)

For higher grades, you will need a Linux environment for some tasks.
