### Task 1: Lock-ins

In this week's course material, you might have heard about concept of lock-ins, often differentiated into **technological** and **vendor lock-ins**. Provide a brief summary of each type of lock-in. Feel free to share any personal insights you may have regarding your own experiences with these lock-ins. Additionally, discuss the potential costs associated with breaking free from these lock-ins and the advantages and disadvantages of remaining within them.

aim for around 150-200 words in your answer and list sources used.

Technological Lock-Ins:
The definition found summarizes that it is when a company becomes highly dependent of a certain technology, to the point that makes it difficulty to implement or switch to another type of technology. Examples cited were "Network effects" which consists on the use of a technology becoming so integrated to a company that the employees fear or don't wanna change it, "Data and content imigration" which consists on the difficulty of transfering data between two different technologies that may cause data loss, and finally "Skill and Expertise" which consists on the need of hiring different skills as the current employees may be skilled in the current technology.
Vendor Lock-Ins:
The definition found summarizes that Vendor lock-ins happens when a company becomes heavily dependent on a particular vendor's products, services, or technology to the extent that switching to an alternative vendor becomes difficult, costly, or even impractical. Examples cited were "Proprietary formats and standards" which consists in the company having a specific standard that can't be provide by other vendors, "High switch cost" which consists in a company invests heavily in a vendor's ecosystem, including software licenses, hardware, and training, the cost and effort required to switch to a different vendor can be substantial, and "Integration and Customization" which consists in stopping a workflow to integrated a custom product into the operations.

### Task2: Security Psychology

Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends!
using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:

- why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
    * Phishing attacks are effective mainly because it relies on people, it is possible to interlink the effectiviness of phishing with some cognitve psychology. As phishing fools people to commit private information to attackers, that happens in the principle of a person blind trusting the internet, that's because the cognitive or self-awareness of most of people is inexisting when it comes in trusting internet in general.
- why social engineering works on people?
    * Social engineering works on people because of the lack of knowledge computer-wise, phishing, vishing, scareware and other types of attack works because it relies on peoples beliefs and not computer system in general, it is easier that a human commit a mistake instead of a machine.
- why many people have hard time using  passwords in secure way?
    * Many people have a Behavioral psychology way of definying secure passwords, usually a person follows a stimuli from external factors like family names or places, which influences the choice for what its supposed to be something secure and it becomes easily hackable. On the other hand, people tend to choose a easy to remenber password and define a similar password to every account.
- why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?
    * At my reseaches, PGP doesnt offer a way of foward secrecy, once your private key is leaked, all past messages encrypted with that key could be in risk.
- why it is so easy to spread malware?
    * Malware is easy to spread because of the principle cited before hand, it depends on how people interact with a message or email. The lack os self-awareness makes it easy to spread. It essentially relies on people and not computers.

no strict length requirements, but aim for 100+ words per question.

## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights

Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like: 

- intellectual property (IP): It refers to creations and inventions, IP is protected by the law and regulations to encourage innovation. Includes: Trademarks, copyrights, patent.
- copyright: It refers to a legal protection that a creator of somenthing receives to reproduce, distribute and display their work. Usually seen in songs, books, films, softwarer..
- patent: It refers to legal monopoly granted to inventors in a period. Patents protect novels and non-obvious inventions.
- trademark: It refers to a distinctive symbol, word, phrase or design used to identify or protect a company's product or services. Good examples would be the apple logo or the nike logo.
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs): It refers to legal contracts that outlines confidential informatios sharing between parties. NDAs are common in business partnerships, mergers, and discussions with potential investors to safeguard proprietary information.

along with employing technologies such as:

- watermarks: Watermarks are things added to images or documents to identify its creator. Photographers usually have watermarks on images to copyright claim it.
- software licenses: It refers to a permission for utilizing or receiving permission to use a specific software. A famous one is the windows license key.
- digital rights management (DRM): It refers to a technology that restricts the use, modification or distribution of digital content. A example would be spotify that uses it to protect its content.
- software protection dongles: It refers to hardware devices that must be connect to a computer to enable the use of a specific software. 

Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each.

### Task3B: Freedom of Information

Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.


DRM: 
In mid-2000’s, Apple Itunes Music Store utilized DRM to protect and restrict the use of music purchased from its platform. The DRM prevented users from playing or using songs on non-apple devices or sharing with others. It was recorded that users became really frustrated with this, because paying for songs and not being able to use it as it wants is frustrating. Several software programs emerged, such as "Requiem" and "QTFairUse," that allowed users to strip the DRM protection from their iTunes-purchased music. These programs exploited vulnerabilities in Apple ITUNES DRM, enabling users to convert their protected music into unrestricted formats. As this happened in a world that was progressing to digital capacities differently, most of people whom bought the songs were frustrated because of the differentiation between old cd’s to the digital matter, in which users could use cd’s which way they wanted to, almost as if the song was a property of them. On the other hand, by paying those songs, people wanted to be able to use it in MP3 players or other devices, some argued that DRM restrictions limited legitimate fair use of copyrighted material, such as creating backups or using music for educational purposes.
Software Protection Dongles:
In this matter is possible to cite some HACK-ROMs as they basically function the same way, old video games were easily modified by hardware devices. But the one I searched for was AUTOCAD a widely used computer-aided design (CAD) software, historically employed hardware dongles to prevent unauthorized use. Users were required to insert a physical dongle into their computer's USB port to run the software. Over the years, there have been instances of bypassing AutoCAD's dongle protection. This involved using software cracks or emulators that simulated the presence of the dongle without the physical device. People who bypassed this instance argued that it would be more convenient to have it in a software not hardware manner, as it’s easier to lose or damaged the external USB, and other than that, the expenses are too high for utilizing that software. And in the end, another point made by users is that sometimes the dongles aren’t compatible with certain devices. Till this day, I usually must crack AutoCAD for my mom because of the expenses and stuff, she is an interior designer and to be paying its license is not too effective money wise. So the trivial point made in the two occurrences is convenience is as important as having the opportunity to use those software, that’s basically why they were bypassed.
